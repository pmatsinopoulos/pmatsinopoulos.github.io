    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am 55 years old at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>Everywhere I look, I see blog posts and messages about AI and coding agents.</p>

<p>Will they take over my job?</p>

<h2>The Way I Think</h2>

<p>Today, I have a specific way of thinking.</p>

<p>When I look back in history, people thought much differently than I think today.</p>

<p>Not only that—when I look at how they thought, I find it quite strange, even unacceptable to me.</p>

<p>What changed the way people think, from how they thought in the past to how they think today, is technology.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s technology that changed the way I think today.</p>

<p>Example: Four hundred years ago, Galileo Galilei proved using his telescope that Earth was not the center of the universe.</p>

<p>Technology is the practical proof of what a mathematician proves on paper. It&rsquo;s the thing that makes me believe and change the way I think.</p>

<h2>I Constantly Question</h2>

<p>The way I think is based on strong beliefs sculpted in my mind by hard proofs and practical evidence.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I need to be in constant questioning.</p>

<p>I question my own beliefs and follow the emergence of new technology.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t just keep working with the tools I used in the past when technology brings new tools for me to work with.</p>

<p>If I don&rsquo;t adapt, I won&rsquo;t be competitive and will be out of a job soon.</p>

<h2>I Unlearn In Order to Learn</h2>

<p>But do I have to constantly unlearn what I know in order to learn new things?</p>

<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a constant balance between what I know and practice on autopilot, and what is new and will make me more productive and effective if I embrace it.</p>

<p>I understand that over the years, I&rsquo;ve built a foundation of knowledge that I rely on. But there are times—not often—when I need to challenge this foundation.</p>

<p>Challenging it doesn&rsquo;t mean it will become completely obsolete.</p>

<p>I need to check whether it&rsquo;s still as strong as it was. It might have weakened.</p>

<p>This is one of those times, I believe.</p>

<p>Parts of the tools and mentality I&rsquo;ve been using need reinforcement.</p>

<p>AI and coding agents are the new tools I need to integrate and solidify into my many-years-built foundation to make it strong again.</p>

<h2>I Keep My Eyes Open And See</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be blind to important changes in technology that affect me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to fall into this mode.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when new information reaches us and challenges our beliefs, we act defensively. We hide behind our old beliefs and harden them.</p>

<p>This is not me. I don&rsquo;t want to be like that. It won&rsquo;t take me anywhere further. It won&rsquo;t help me grow as a person or as a professional.</p>

<p>I will fairly judge and evaluate what comes to me. I will embrace new forces that are shaping my life and make them my own powers and strengths.</p>

<h2>I Have A Beginner&rsquo;s Mind With An Expert&rsquo;s View</h2>

<p>Am I an expert?</p>

<p>Yes I am.</p>

<p>I have designed, implemented, and deployed to production numerous products and projects in various business domains.</p>

<p>I have an expert&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>But I need to have a beginner&rsquo;s mind too.</p>

<p>The beginner&rsquo;s mind will see what is coming.</p>

<p>I need to see what is coming.</p>

<p>I need to see what has already come. It is here.</p>

<p>This is a time of great change, and only my beginner&rsquo;s mind will see the benefits, engage, and take advantage of it.</p>

<p>As an expert with a beginner&rsquo;s mind, I will carry out a creative destruction.</p>

<p>I will destroy my old, legacy beliefs about outdated tools to embrace new tools for even more creativity, productivity, and—why not—happiness.</p>

<h2>I Temper My Confidence and Strengthen My Humility</h2>

<p>I have been confident about my approach, my tools, and the way I&rsquo;ve addressed software engineering problems.</p>

<p>I still am.</p>

<p>But this confidence doesn&rsquo;t make me stubborn.</p>

<p>The ingredient of humility makes the combination perfect.</p>

<p>Humility is one of my five values (Honesty - Humility - Empathy - Trust - Kaizen).</p>

<p>Humility challenges my confidence for good reason: to make me stronger and more confident in using and believing in the new that is coming and is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Humility makes me ask for advice from outside objective observers.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not bad to ask. Being in the software industry for so many years and being an expert doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not allowed to ask.</p>

<p>I ask because I am humble and I believe in asking.</p>

<p>I ask others, especially younger people, because they have the beginner&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>And that makes me stronger and more confident.</p>

<h2>I am Not Looking for a Villain</h2>

<p>I understand that people want to be heroes in stories where there is always a villain to fight against.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t do that. I like major scales rather than minor scales in my work.</p>

<p>I am optimistic and I trust (which is another one of my values).</p>

<p>You may think that the coding agent is the villain in your own superhero story.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see it like that. I don&rsquo;t want to be a hero in any such story.</p>

<p>The coding agent is my companion, the partner I create with and enjoy the value we bring to humans together.</p>

<h2>I Survive In An Uncertain Future</h2>

<p>The future is uncertain.</p>

<p>What I can be certain of is myself and how I approach the new technology boom.</p>

<p>With &ldquo;strong beliefs, weakly held.&rdquo; [1]</p>

<h2>Closing Note</h2>

<p>Yesterday, I used the Copilot Coding Agent:</p>

<ul>
<li>I assigned an issue to it</li>
<li>I reviewed its pull request and made comments</li>
<li>The agent came back with improvements and corrections</li>
<li>I reviewed again and finally approved the pull request</li>
<li>I merged it, and it was pushed to production thanks to CI/CD (GitHub Actions)</li>
</ul>


<p>I am happy I live in the era of this huge technology change.</p>
