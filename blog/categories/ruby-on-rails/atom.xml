    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today, I had to find a way to make my production Rails application log into different log files per process. I have
the application deployed using <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Phusion Passenger</a> as an Apache 2 module. The reason
I decided to do that was the fact that I wanted to analyze the logs with <a href="https://github.com/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer">Request Log Analyzer</a> tool.
This tool requires the log files to be separate so that they do not interleave the log entries of different requests.</p>

<p>This post is sponsored by <a href="http://www.fraudpointer.com/">Fraudpointer</a>.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>In order to solve that I was helped by what I found about the similar problem solved for Unicorn processes here:</p>

<p><a href="http://jordan.broughs.net/archives/2014/09/provide-separate-rails-log-files-for-each-unicorn-worker">A blog about how one can have different log file per Unicorn worker</a></p>

<p>Then, I had to google about how I could hook to after fork events on Phusion Passenger. There was a very good <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/24180809/658469">question here</a>
and its <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/24188716/658469">answer here</a>. The answer directed me also on Phusion Passenger documentation for
<a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/indepth/ruby/spawn_methods/#smart-spawning-hooks">hooking on spawning events</a>.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>I have created an initializer with the following content:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">begin
  if Rails.env.production? &amp;&amp; defined?(PhusionPassenger)
    PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
      # get access to log device
      if Rails::VERSION::STRING.start_with?('4.')
        logdev = Rails.logger.instance_variable_get(:@logdev)
      elsif Rails::VERSION::STRING.start_with?('3.2')
        logdev = Rails.logger.instance_variable_get(:@logger).instance_variable_get(:@log).instance_variable_get(:@logdev)
      end

      # logdev.dev is a File instance that is the open file to log file.
      # Get the extension and prepend the process id.
      ext = File.extname(logdev.dev.path)
      pid = Process.pid
      path = logdev.dev.path.gsub /#{Regexp.escape(ext)}$/, ".#{pid}#{ext}"

      # open the new file
      file = File.open(path, 'a')
      file.binmode
      file.sync = true

      # We flush and close the current file handle, the one that writes to the single file.
      logdev.dev.flush
      logdev.dev.close

      # We replace the file handle with the new one +file+ that refers to process specific file.
      logdev.instance_variable_set(:@dev, file)
    end
  end
rescue Exception =&gt; ex
  begin
    Rails.logger.error(ex.message)
    Rails.logger.error(ex.backtrace)
  rescue
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>This has been implemented for a Rails 3.2 and a Rails 4.2 application.</p>

<p>Any feedback from you would be much appreciated.</p>

    <link href="http://pmatsinopoulos.github.io/blog/2015/08/08/rails-params-does-the-job/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-08T10:07:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://pmatsinopoulos.github.io/blog/2015/08/08/rails-params-does-the-job</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you have a Ruby on Rails end point, the client usually sends data in one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>For <code>GET</code> requests, URL encoded in the URI</li>
<li>For <code>POST</code> requests, in the body of the request encoded with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> or <code>application/json</code> or other popular format.</li>
</ol>


<p>Sometimes, there is a combination of the above methods. In other words, in a <code>POST</code> request, some of the data may come both URL encoded in the URI and other data may come encoded with
another method in the body of the request.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>How do we get the data inside our Rails controller?</h2>

<p>Rails does a very good job and allows us to have access to the data sent by the client in a very easy way. This is called <code>params</code> hash.
The <code>params</code> hash holds the data in a <code>Hash</code> version no matter how the data have been sent by the client. You will find in the <code>params</code> hash
data that have been sent URL encoded on the URI of the request, or <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> in the body of the request or with
any other method.</p>

<h2>Echo Data Service</h2>

<p>I have very quickly created an echo data service and I have deployed that here:</p>

<p><a href="https://echo-data.herokuapp.com/">https://echo-data.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

<p>The source code of that is here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pmatsinopoulos/echo">https://github.com/pmatsinopoulos/echo</a></p>

<p>What does it do? It returns back to client the data that the client sends to server. The response is a JSON object with two properties. The <code>params</code> value and the <code>request.body</code> value.
The <code>params</code> value will show to you how the controller has interpreted the data sent by the client. The <code>request.body</code> will show you how the body has been actually received.</p>

<h2>Testing the service</h2>

<p>You can use some <code>curl</code> commands to test the echo data service. Here is how:</p>

<h3>Send data URL encoded as part of the URI</h3>

<p>This example sends the data URL encoded as part of the URI.</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://echo-data.herokuapp.com/echo?foo=bar" -v --header "Accept: application/json"
</code></pre>

<p>As you see in the output of the <code>curl</code> that is given below, this is a <code>GET</code> request and the <code>Content-Type</code> header is not
specified, because the data are part of the URI.</p>

<pre><code>* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 54.243.224.121...
* Connected to echo-data.herokuapp.com (54.243.224.121) port 443 (#0)
&gt; GET /echo?foo=bar HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
&gt; Host: echo-data.herokuapp.com
&gt; Accept: application/json
&gt; 
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
&lt; Connection: keep-alive
&lt; X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
&lt; X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
&lt; X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
&lt; Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
&lt; Etag: W/"d83be65a785d7935d5b38bfcb091f75f"
&lt; Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
&lt; X-Request-Id: 6e888864-0e1a-4f34-8f24-8c2d57f962f3
&lt; X-Runtime: 0.006788
* Server WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13) is not blacklisted
&lt; Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13)
&lt; Date: Sat, 08 Aug 2015 09:11:42 GMT
&lt; Content-Length: 82
&lt; Via: 1.1 vegur
&lt; 
* Connection #0 to host echo-data.herokuapp.com left intact
{"params":{"foo":"bar","controller":"echo","action":"echo"},"request":{"body":""}}
</code></pre>

<p>The last line above is the actual response payload returned from the echo data service. As you can see,
the <code>params</code> hash contains the key <code>foo</code> with value <code>bar</code>. Note that <code>request.body</code> is empty, because we
didn&rsquo;t send anything there.</p>

<h3>Send data URL encoded in the request body</h3>

<p>With this example we will send the data using a <code>POST</code> request and the data will be
url encoded in the request body.</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://echo-data.herokuapp.com/echo" -v --data foo=bar --header "Accept: application/json"
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from the <code>curl</code> output below, the request is a <code>POST</code> request and the <code>Content-Type</code>
is automatically set to <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.</p>

<pre><code>* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 23.21.247.21...
* Connected to echo-data.herokuapp.com (23.21.247.21) port 443 (#0)
&gt; POST /echo HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
&gt; Host: echo-data.herokuapp.com
&gt; Accept: application/json
&gt; Content-Length: 7
&gt; Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
&gt;

&lt; Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13)
&lt; Date: Sat, 08 Aug 2015 09:12:58 GMT
&lt; Content-Length: 89
&lt; Set-Cookie: request_method=POST; path=/
&lt; Via: 1.1 vegur
&lt; 
* Connection #0 to host echo-data.herokuapp.com left intact
{"params":{"foo":"bar","controller":"echo","action":"echo"},"request":{"body":"foo=bar"}}
</code></pre>

<p>The last line above, is the actual payload response content. It demonstrates that the <code>params</code> hash
has successfully identified the data sent and that you can use it to retrieve it for further processing
in your controller. See how the <code>request.body</code> now is not empty, since <code>curl</code> sent the data in the
body of the request.</p>

<h3>Send data as a JSON string inside the request body</h3>

<p>In the following example we are sending the data as a JSON string in the body of the request:</p>

<pre><code class="`"> curl "https://echo-data.herokuapp.com/echo" -v --header "Accept: application/json" --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"foo\":\"data\"}"
</code></pre>

<p> What <code>curl</code> returns back is:</p>

<pre><code>* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 54.225.207.60...
* Connected to echo-data.herokuapp.com (54.225.207.60) port 443 (#0)
&gt; POST /echo HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
&gt; Host: echo-data.herokuapp.com
&gt; Accept: application/json
&gt; Content-Type: application/json
&gt; Content-Length: 14
&gt; 
* upload completely sent off: 14 out of 14 bytes
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
&lt; Connection: keep-alive
&lt; X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

&lt; Etag: W/"27ba5f1877a65ff394f1899ac75f3449"
&lt; Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
&lt; X-Request-Id: ecdd54eb-7d99-45b2-9872-cca20a63394c
&lt; X-Runtime: 0.007516
* Server WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13) is not blacklisted
&lt; Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13)
&lt; Date: Sat, 08 Aug 2015 09:17:32 GMT
&lt; Content-Length: 123
&lt; Set-Cookie: request_method=POST; path=/
&lt; Via: 1.1 vegur
&lt; 
* Connection #0 to host echo-data.herokuapp.com left intact
{"params":{"foo":"data","controller":"echo","action":"echo","echo":{"foo":"data"}},"request":{"body":"{\"foo\":\"data\"}"}} 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from the <code>curl</code> output, the request is a <code>POST</code> request. The last line shows that, even in that case,
the <code>params</code> hash holds the data in a way that we can handle it from our controller code. See also how the <code>request.body</code>
bears the JSON string sent over.</p>

<h3>Combine data on URI and data in request body</h3>

<p>In the following example, we combine the data on URI and data in request body:</p>

<pre><code>curl "https://echo-data.herokuapp.com/echo?hello=world" -v --header "Accept: application/json" --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"foo\":\"data\"}"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>curl</code> output in that case is:</p>

<pre><code>* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 54.243.163.2...
* Connected to echo-data.herokuapp.com (54.243.163.2) port 443 (#0)    
&gt; POST /echo?hello=world HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
&gt; Host: echo-data.herokuapp.com
&gt; Accept: application/json
&gt; Content-Type: application/json
&gt; Content-Length: 14
&gt; 
* upload completely sent off: 14 out of 14 bytes
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
&lt; Connection: keep-alive
&lt; X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
&lt; X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
&lt; X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
&lt; Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
&lt; Etag: W/"47484987479c63ee1f544f7c94886d5d"
&lt; Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
&lt; X-Request-Id: 5c6d5d7c-8289-45d7-8fb4-d0909e19898d
&lt; X-Runtime: 0.055496
* Server WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13) is not blacklisted
&lt; Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13)
&lt; Date: Sat, 08 Aug 2015 09:23:59 GMT
&lt; Content-Length: 139
&lt; Set-Cookie: request_method=POST; path=/
&lt; Via: 1.1 vegur
&lt; 
* Connection #0 to host echo-data.herokuapp.com left intact
{"params":{"foo":"data","hello":"world","controller":"echo","action":"echo","echo":{"foo":"data"}},"request":{"body":"{\"foo\":\"data\"}"}}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from the last line, the data in the URI, <code>hello=world</code> have been put in the <code>params</code>. Same goes for data in the request body.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The above article and corresponding examples and code try to show to you how the <code>params</code> hash is the single place to go if you want
to process the data that a client program is sending to your Ruby on Rails end point.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many software engineers do not write tests for their UI because they have a good reason not to. Firstly, they believe that UI changes frequently, so any test would have been vulnerable to frequent changes. Secondly, they do not know about the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html">Page Object Pattern</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have been introduced to Page Object Pattern by a QA Engineer, <a href="http://gr.linkedin.com/in/stylianospapadomichelakis">Stylianos Papadomichelakis</a> while we were colleagues at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/e-travel-sa">E-TRAVEL S.A.</a>. He has been using that for his QA tests, although in the Java world. I was astounded by this pattern. What a pain I got while trying to migrate a huge test suite from <code>capybara</code> 1 to <code>capybara</code> 2. If only I had page object pattern from the beginning, a 2 weeks task would have finished in 2 days.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html">explains</a>, very clearly, as always, how useful this pattern is for testing UI, and how it can insulate your tests from the frequest UI changes. When using it, change effects on the UI of your application will not have to be propagated throughout your whole test suite, but only inside your page objects.</p>

<p>And thank God, for our <code>Ruby</code> world, there is an awesome implementation of the page object pattern. The gem is called <code>site_prism</code> and you can read about it here: <a href="https://github.com/natritmeyer/site_prism">Site Prism</a>. It has very good documentation and will really help you love this gem.</p>

<p>In this article, I am going to share with you my experience using this gem. Using it for quite some time on all of my projects since I met it, I have come up with some best practices which I am sharing with you here.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start</p>

<h3>Use a <code>page_objects</code> directory</h3>

<p>Put your page object Ruby files inside a directory structure that would have as parent the <code>page_objects</code> directory. So, if for example you have a Rails application, the directory structure might be:</p>

<pre><code>app
bin
config
db
features
lib
log
page_objects
public
script
spec
tmp
vendor
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the <code>page_objects</code> is on the same directory level like the <code>features</code> which contains the <code>Cucumber</code> features and the <code>spec</code> which contains the <code>RSpec</code> test files. <code>Cucumber</code> and <code>RSpec</code> will both be using your <code>page_objects</code>.</p>

<h3>Use <code>&lt;your-app-name&gt;/page_objects</code> namespace</h3>

<p>Although you are free to put all of your page object files inside the <code>page_objects</code> directory, prefer to use a sub-directory with the name of your application that would function as namespace. Further namespace that, with the word <code>page_objects</code>. For example, if your application is called <code>bookstore</code>, then you can use the following tree to store your page objects:</p>

<pre><code>page_objects
  |-&gt; bookstore
        |-&gt; page_objects
</code></pre>

<p>Any <code>.rb</code> file that you will be creating to hold a page object class, will need to be inside the corresponding module <code>Bookstore::PageObjects</code> that will work as a namespace.
Using namespace is a good practice in general and not only for the <code>site_prism</code> case we are discussing here. You will avoid having name conflicts with third-party gems.</p>

<h3>Use a file to require them all</h3>

<p>Write an <code>all_page_objects.rb</code> file that will require all the page objects Ruby files that would be living in your <code>page_objects</code> tree.</p>

<pre><code>page_objects
  |-&gt; bookstore
  |     |-&gt; page_objects
  |- all_page_objects.rb
</code></pre>

<p>An implementation of <code>all_page_objects.rb</code> file might be something like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/all_page_objects.rb
#
current_path = File.expand_path('..', __FILE__)
$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.join(current_path, 'bookstore')

Dir.glob(File.join(current_path, '**', '*.rb')).each do |f|
  require f
end
</code></pre>

<p>Having done that, you only have to require the <code>all_page_objects</code> file from your <code>spec_helper.rb</code> or <code>env.rb</code> file. And everytime a new page object file is defined, you do not have to require that explicitly.</p>

<h3>Different directory for pages and sections</h3>

<p>Site prism offers two classes to organize your page object code. Pages and Sections. Use a separate directory to hold your page classes and a separate directory to hold your sections classes.</p>

<pre><code>page_objects
  |-&gt; bookstore
  |     |-&gt; page_objects
  |           |-&gt; pages
  |           |-&gt; sections
  |- all_page_objects.rb
</code></pre>

<p>You will use each one of these two directories to further namespace your classes. Hence all your page object classes that are pages will be <code>Bookstore::PageObjects::Pages::</code> namespaced, and all your page object classes that are sections will be <code>Bookstore::PageObjects::Sections::</code> namespaced.</p>

<h3>Follow your views directory structure</h3>

<p>Although you can put all your page classes inside the <code>page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/pages</code> directory, you should be further separating your pages directory into subdirectories that follow your views directory structure.</p>

<p>If for example you have a views directory that has two directories, <code>books</code> and <code>authors</code>, former one having the views that are related to <code>Book</code> resource and latter one having the views that are related to <code>Author</code> resource, you should have corresponding directories inside the <code>page_objects/pages</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>page_objects
  |-&gt; bookstore
  |     |-&gt; page_objects
  |           |-&gt; pages
  |           |     |-&gt; books
  |           |     |-&gt; authors
  |           |-&gt; sections
  |- all_page_objects.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Think about whether you can do the same for the <code>sections</code> too. If you have <code>sections</code> that are resource specific, you can follow a similar directory structure.</p>

<p>In any case, the page classes that you will define will need to be further namespaced.</p>

<h3>Follow your views templates</h3>

<p>When defining your actual page classes follow the views templates and create one page per template view. For example, if you have a view template that indexes all the books in your bookstore, e.g. <code>index.html.erb</code> inside the <code>books</code> view directory, then create the corresponding page inside the file <code>index_page.rb</code>. Similarly for <code>new</code>, <code>show</code>, <code>edit</code> views:</p>

<pre><code>page_objects
  |-&gt; bookstore
  |     |-&gt; page_objects
  |           |-&gt; pages
  |           |     |-&gt; books
  |           |     |---- index_page.rb
  |           |     |---- new_page.rb
  |           |     |---- show_page.rb
  |           |     |---- edit_page.rb
  |           |     |-&gt; authors
  |           |     |---- index_page.rb
  |           |     |---- new_page.rb
  |           |     |---- show_page.rb
  |           |     |---- edit_page.rb
  |           |-&gt; sections
  |- all_page_objects.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Hence, your page classes will be defined as follows (example for the <code>index_page.rb</code> for <code>books</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/pages/books/index_page.rb
#
module Bookstore
  module PageObjects
    module Pages
      module Books
        class IndexPage &lt; SitePrism::Page
          # ... your page code goes here ... #
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h3>One file to model your application</h3>

<p>Create a file <code>application.rb</code> that will be used to instantiate the concrete page classes and will be used to access all the pages while working with site prism API on <code>feautures</code> <code>steps</code> or <code>spec</code> tests.
<code>
page_objects
  |-&gt; bookstore
  |     |-&gt; page_objects
  |           |-&gt; pages
  |           |     |-&gt; books
  |           |     |---- index_page.rb
  |           |     |---- new_page.rb
  |           |     |---- show_page.rb
  |           |     |---- edit_page.rb
  |           |     |-&gt; authors
  |           |     |---- index_page.rb
  |           |     |---- new_page.rb
  |           |     |---- show_page.rb
  |           |     |---- edit_page.rb
  |           |-&gt; sections
  |           |- application.rb
  |- all_page_objects.rb
</code></p>

<p>So, you are going to have <code>page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/application.rb</code>
Here is a sample implementation in order to understand what I am talking about:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/application.rb
#
module Bookstore
  module PageObjects
    class Application
      def initialize
        @pages = {}
      end

      def home
        @pages[:home] ||= Bookstore::PageObjects::Pages::HomePage.new
      end

      def sign_in
        @pages[:sign_in] ||= Bookstore::PageObjects::Pages::SignInPage.new
      end

      def checkout
        @pages[:checkout] ||= Bookstore::PageObjects::Pages::CheckoutPage.new
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>When you will be using site prism, you will only be instantiating the <code>Bookstore::PageObjects::Application</code> class once and then you will be invoking page methods to access specific pages. For example:</p>

<p>If using <code>Cucumber</code>, inside the <code>features/support/hooks.rb</code> file you can have</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Before do |scenario|
  @app ||= Bookstore::PageObjects::Application.new
end
</code></pre>

<p>which will instantiate the <code>Bookstore::PageObjects::Application</code> and store it in <code>@app</code> that you can use to load and access pages as follows (in your <code>steps</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">When(/^User visits the home pages$/)do
  @app.home.load
end

When(/^User visits the sign in page$/) do
  @app.sign_in.load
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the <code>Bookstore::PageObjects::Application</code> is being instantiated only once and each page is being instantiated only once too. The application instance is using, internally, a hash to store the instances of the necessary pages. So, everytime you need a page, either an existing instance of the page will be returned, if you have requested same page in the past, case in which it will be located in the <code>@pages</code> hash, or a new instance will be created.</p>

<h3><code>elements</code> vs <code>sections</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, especially when you are new to site prism, you cannot decide very easily when you should be using <code>elements</code> vs <code>sections</code>.</p>

<p>If you understand the difference between an <code>element</code> and a <code>section</code> then it should be easy.</p>

<p><code>element</code> is primitive dom selection that cannot contain other elements.</p>

<p><code>section</code> should be used whenever you have a dom area that you want to select and that you want to treat its constituent elements separately, with further site prism API manipulation. In other words, <code>section</code> should be containing one or more <code>element</code> (and/or other <code>element</code>s, <code>elements</code>, <code>section</code>s or <code>sections</code>).</p>

<p>Finally, both <code>elements</code> and <code>sections</code> select structures of the dom that appear as arrays in the dom. <code>elements</code> select an array of <code>element</code>. <code>sections</code> select an array of <code>section</code>.</p>

<p>Hence, if you have an index page that displays the list of books, you can have the following inside the index page definition:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/pages/books/index_page.rb
#
module Bookstore
  module PageObjects
    module Pages
      module Books
        class IndexPage &lt; SitePrism::Page

          elements :book_items, '#books-table tr.book-item'

        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>which will give you access to each one of the table rows that are used to display a book entry. But this definition does not allow to do too much with the book item itself.</p>

<p>If for example, you want to access details of the book, you can use a section and say that you have an array of sections, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/pages/books/index_page.rb
#
require "bookstore/page_objects/sections/books/book_entry_section"

module Bookstore
  module PageObjects
    module Pages
      module Books
        class IndexPage &lt; SitePrism::Page

          sections :book_items, Bookstore::PageObjects::Sections::Books::BookEntrySection, '#books-table tr.book-item'

        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then you need to define the book entry details in the corresponding section file:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/sections/books/book_entry_section.rb
#
module Bookstore
  module PageObjects
    module Sections
      module Books
        class BookEntrySection &lt; SitePrism::Section
          element :title,        'td.title'
          element :author,       'td.author'
          element :published_at, 'td.published-at'
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But, again&hellip;.</p>

<h3>Prefer inline <code>section</code> (and <code>sections</code>) blocks</h3>

<p>You should not be using separate class definitions for sections of pages that are not reusable among pages. It&rsquo;s waste of effort, time and requires more maintenance. Create a separate class, on a seperate file, for a section, only if this section can be reused among page definitions. Otherwise, define the section elements inline with a block.</p>

<p>Hence, the above implementation for the book item, is not something that I recommend. I wouldn&rsquo;t create a section for that. You should just define the section elements inline as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># file: page_objects/bookstore/page_objects/pages/books/index_page.rb
#
module Bookstore
  module PageObjects
    module Pages
      module Books
        class IndexPage &lt; SitePrism::Page
          # .... other index page code .... #

          sections :book_items, '#books-table tr.book-item' do
            element :title,        'td.title'
            element :author,       'td.author'
            element :published_at, 'td.published-at'
          end                    

          # ... other index page code ... #
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Doing so, I do not have to create another class file specific to this section.</p>

<p>Note that this hint is valid both for <code>section</code> and <code>sections</code>, of course.</p>

<h3>Use ids - Do not use style properties for selectors</h3>

<p>This suggestion goes out of the scope of site prism. When you are using selectors to select dom elements on your tests use html element ids, e.g. &lsquo;#books-table&rsquo; as much as you can. Do not use other attributes that style your elements or depend on the layout and structure of your dom. They are brittle to change. And if you write your tests and you see that your pages are missing ids that would help you write your tests, then go back to your core code and add ids.</p>

<h2>Final</h2>

<p>I believe that the page object pattern is a fantastic practice to isolate your tests from accessing UI test API (like <code>Capybara</code>) directly. And <a href="https://github.com/natritmeyer/site_prism">site_prism</a> is a perfect implementation.</p>

<p>I hope that the above notes can help you organize your page objects code and become a practice in your development/QA team. Or at least start a discussion inside it about how you can better organize your page objects code.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any comment and feedback to make the above even better.</p>
