I believe that testing is the most important part of the software development lifecycle. Nothing is ready unless it passes successfully all tests.

Meanwhile, I am trying to test as much aspects of my Rails application as possible. One such are the validations that I have on my models. To help my task on testing validations, I have created a gem that helps me out there.

You can find more details here:
