[This](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) is a very good guide on how one should style its Ruby code. I am following this since I started Ruby and I suggest that everybody does the same.

One extra on usage of {...} vs do...end blocks can be found [here (Weirich Convention)](http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Ruby/BraceVsDoEnd.rdoc).
