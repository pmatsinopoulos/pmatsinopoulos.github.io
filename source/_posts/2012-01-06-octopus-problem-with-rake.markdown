This week I have decided to use [octopus](https://github.com/tchandy/octopus), a fantastic gem for realizing replication or sharding. I have already implemented MySQL Replication (Master / Slave) and I wanted to have my Ruby on Rails application actually use it!

This is my github project: [Octopus Replication Example](https://github.com/pmatsinopoulos/octopus_replication_example)

Your comments are welcome!
