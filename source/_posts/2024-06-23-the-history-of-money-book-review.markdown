I am leveling up on web3/blockchain in two dimensions:

1. The technology and
2. The business.

In the business dimension, I certainly want to learn a lot about Money and how it functions.

To this objective, I just finished the book

"The History of Money", authored by Jack Weatherford.

Even if this book is a little old (1997), it really helped me a lot to understand how the money came to be what it is today. It certainly served its purpose. I am really glad I read it and I highly recommend it
