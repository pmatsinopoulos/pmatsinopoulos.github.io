## Special consideration for TDD/BDD

I heavily relied on TDD (Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) to implement this project. Which means that I started with RSpec expectations and shoulds
and then moved to implementation. Also, I have written some Acceptance Testing Scenarios using Cucumber, working again with BDD.
